It evolved to become the largest beach clean-ups in the world, garnered praise and awe from around the world, and was recognised by no less than the United Nations, which awarded him the Champions of the Earth award."I am a lawyer at the Mumbai High Court. Two years ago, I moved to Versova, Mumbai. The beach there was unbearably polluted. There was plastic everywhere – on the jetty beach, on the sand, on foot-walks – plastic everywhere.", he said.

One such trend has been the conversion of plastic waste to fuel and making it usable for both domestic and industrial purposes. Given India’s huge daily generation of over 15,000 tonnes of plastic, the prospects of conversion to fuel are abundant, provided there is sufficient infrastructure available.Countries like Japan, Germany and the United States have already implemented the plastic to fuel conversion process with much success. These three have also been successful in creating business models out of the conversion process, resulting in the conversion model becoming a profitable business one. </p>

Medha’s tryst with plastic began in 2009, when she and her friend Shirish Phadtare were appalled at the amount of plastic garbage casually thrown around and often wondered if anything could be done to put plastic waste to use. This resulted in extensive research by the two women who deducted that usable fuel could be obtained from plastics, using the mechanism of thermos-catalytic depolymerisation. Subsequently, Rudra Environmental Solutions was founded and in 2010, the first plastic to fuel conversion machine was set up in Pune.

our purchased goods when we go shopping. They are a part of our modern lives, and we don’t tend to think much about them. However, this convenience of plastic shopping bags carries with it a very high cost to the environment and also negatively affects human health.

Because there are so many negative impacts from the use of plastic shopping bags, many cities and countries from around the world have already put plastic bag bans in place. The following are a number of reasons why local and national governments should consider instituting bans on plastic bags.
